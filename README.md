# AI-Powered News Classification 🚀
## Overview
This project is part of my internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions, where I built an AI model to classify news articles based on patterns from a given dataset. The model analyzes text data and predicts whether a news article aligns with the dataset’s learned patterns.

## Features
✔️ Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training
✔️ ML Model Training – Implementing machine learning techniques for text classification
✔️ Evaluation & Analysis – Measuring model performance on test data
✔️ Streamlit Web App – A user-friendly interface to interact with the model

## Tech Stack
🔹 Python
🔹 Streamlit
🔹 Pandas
🔹 Scikit-learn
🔹 NumPy

## How It Works
1️⃣ Input a news article into the web app
2️⃣ The model analyzes the text and predicts a category based on its training data
3️⃣ The output provides insights based on learned patterns from the dataset

## Limitations
⚠️ This model only makes predictions within the scope of the dataset it was trained on. It does not verify real-world accuracy beyond the given data.

## Future Enhancements
🚀 Expanding the dataset for better generalization
📈 Implementing deep learning techniques for improved accuracy
🌍 Exploring real-time news validation with external sources
